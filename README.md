# Epsilon-Greedy Enhanced LODCO for Multi-Server MEC

This repository contains the manuscript/report for my research on computation offloading in a multi-user, multi-server mobile edge computing (MEC) system under stochastic task arrivals and energy-harvesting constraints.

## Core idea
I introduce structured epsilon-greedy exploration only in the server-selection stage, while preserving Lyapunov-based decisions for local execution and dropping, aiming to improve performance while maintaining queue stability.

## What’s inside
- Problem formulation and constraints
- Proposed policy and rationale
- Simulation setup and experimental results

## Document
